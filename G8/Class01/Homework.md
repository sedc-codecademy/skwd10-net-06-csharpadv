# Homework
* Create interfaces called IAnimal, IDog, ICat
* IAnimal : Contains method PrintAnimal
* IDog - Contains method Bark
* ICat - Contains method Eat that gets parameter food of type string
* Create an abstract class Animal (you choose the properties) that implements IAnimal, with abstract method PrintAnimal 
* Create class Dog that implements IDog and inherits from Animal. Implement PrintAnimal but also Bark.
* Create class Cat that implements ICat and inherits from Animal. Implement PrintAnimal but also Eat.
* Create several objects and test the method calls

** Bonus
* Create a list of Animal and add members that are of type Cat and Dog. 
* Iterate the list, use GetType for each member to see the type of animal. If it is a dog call its bark method, if it is a cat call the Eat method.
